  # Objective
  
  The objective of this study was to identify potential gene expression biomarkers associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection by analyzing RNA-Seq data from whole blood of 19 COVID-19 patients and 17 healthy controls. Analyses included data acquisition, preprocessing, differential expression analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction, hub gene identification, and functional enrichment (Gene Ontology, KEGG, Reactome).

# Dataset Details

- **GEO Accession:** GSE270045  
- **Study Title:** Up-regulation of olfactory receptors and neuronal-associated genes highlights complex immune and neuronal dysregulation in Long COVID patients  
- **Number of Samples:** 36 (19 COVID-19 patients, 17 healthy controls)  
- **Platform:** Illumina NovaSeq X Plus (Homo sapiens)  
- **Study Design:** Case-control (patients vs healthy controls)  

# Methods

## Data Acquisition and Preprocessing

1. Raw gene expression counts were downloaded from GEO Supplementary files.  
2. Metadata was prepared with patient/control annotations.  
3. Low-expression genes were filtered: only genes with expression >1 in ≥5 samples were retained.  
4. PCA was performed to visualize clustering before and after batch effect correction.

**Figure 2:** PCA plot after batch effect correction (insert PNG here)  

## Differential Expression Analysis

DEGs were identified using DESeq2 with padj < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1. Shrinkage of log2 fold changes was applied using `ashr`.

## PPI Network and Hub Genes

Hub genes were identified from the Cytoscape PPI network:  
  `LHX5, IGF2, SLC22A18AS, C16orf71, PBX4, PKNOX2, FEZF2, RELN, MEIS2, PBX2`

# Results

- **Number of DEGs:** `r nrow(sig_DEGs)`  
- Volcano plot (Figure 3) shows significant up- and down-regulated genes.  
- Heatmap (Figure 4) shows top 20 DEGs.  
- Top 15 up/down genes listed in Tables 1 & 2.  
- Hub genes shown in Figures 5–6.  
- Enrichment results shown in Figures 7–12.  

# Discussion

- Dysregulated immune and neuronal pathways identified in COVID-19 patients.  
- Hub genes (IGF2, RELN, FEZF2) may serve as candidate biomarkers.  
- KEGG and Reactome pathway analysis highlights immune signaling and olfactory pathways.  

# Conclusion

- RNA-Seq analysis identified DEGs, hub genes, and enriched pathways differentiating COVID-19 patients from controls.  
- Hub genes and functional enrichment highlight candidate biomarkers for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
